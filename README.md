# **Dantotsu** üåü

Dantotsu is (mostly) an [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) only client.

> **Dantotsu (Êñ≠„Éà„ÉÑ; Dan-totsu)** literally means "the best of the best" in Japanese.
> Try it out for yourself and be the judge!

# **Mr. Matagi** üí¶

Mr. Matagi is aimed at improving upon it.

> **Mataagi (ÂèàÊú®; Mata-gi)** means "forked branch" in Japanese. 
> A copy of a project is a fork and a collection of changes is a branch.
