### Note: I am not a Dantotsu collaborator, nor member of its Discord.
This fork began after reading multiple reviews of the promising UI, but excessive number of bugs. I cleared a decent chunk of the backlog before deciding that the condescending attitude of the project owner, lack of collaboration by an unskilled developer with push access, and sheer volume of copied code were red flags. After explaining my reasoning, I excused myself from further involvement.

# **Dantotsu** 🌟

Dantotsu is (mostly) an [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) only client.

> **Dantotsu (断トツ; Dan-totsu)** literally means "the best of the best" in Japanese. Try it out for yourself and be the judge!

# **Mr. Matagi** 💦

Mr. Matagi is aimed at improving upon it.

> **Mataagi (又木; Mata-gi)** means "forked branch" in Japanese. A copy of a project is a fork and a collection of changes is a branch.
